      A croissant is a buttery, flaky pastry of Austrian origin, named for its
      crescent shape. It is made of layered yeast-leavened dough, which is
      folded and rolled several times in succession, then rolled into a sheet
      that is cut into triangular segments before being rolled into a crescent
      shape. Croissants are often eaten for breakfast or as a snack, and they
      can be plain or filled with ingredients such as chocolate or almond paste.
      They are a popular pastry in French and international cuisine.
